## This is a project I did to practice my HTML, CSS & Javascript

Originally I'm planning to make a real app but before I take that big step I wanted to play with HTML and CSS first

As Web Development isn't what I normally do, I still wanted to try it out at least, compared to trying to make a space invaders game I saw Tic-Tac-Toe is more simple

When doing a little research I found 3 websites. [CodePen](https://codepen.io) which has a window for HTML, CSS and Javascript, with a live preview of the outcome all in one tab, uploaded my code from VS Code and made everything easier

Sadly to publish the app on the Google Play Store there is a one time fee of $25 so I'll wait until I publish my real app first
