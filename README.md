## This is a project I did to practice my HTML, CSS & Javascript so please don't mind it for it's looks.

Originally I'm planning to make a real app but before I take that big step I wanted to play with HTML and CSS since the last time I did was for college assignments

As Web Development isn't what I do I still wanted to try it out at least, compared to trying to make a space invaders game I saw Tic-Tac-Toe is much more simple

That's when I also found an article in my research of someone using [CodePen](https://codepen.io) which uses a window for HTML, CSS and Javascript code as well as a live preview of the outcome all in one window, uploaded my code from VS Code and made everything easier

After that, compress the folder and uploaded it to [Tiiny Host](https://tiiny.host) having such a small folder size, it's now up on the internet for free

And for the third surprise, they mention how to turn that site into a mobile app through [WEBINTOAPP](https://www.webintoapp.com) although it's only free for Android, works for me, installed it via APK and works just like the site

Sadly to publish the app on the Google Play Store there is a one time fee of $25 so I'll wait until I publish my real app first
